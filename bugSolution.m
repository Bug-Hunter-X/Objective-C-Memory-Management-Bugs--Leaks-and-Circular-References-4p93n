The solution involves careful implementation of memory management principles. For leaks, ensure that every `alloc`, `new`, or `copy` operation is balanced by a corresponding `release` or `autorelease` (or using ARC's strong/weak properties).  Circular references are resolved by using weak references where appropriate. For delegate patterns, always set the delegate to `nil` when the object that holds the reference is deallocated.  Proper use of `copy` ensures that you're working with a new object, preventing modification issues in shared objects.

//Corrected code (Illustrative):

@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) id <MyDelegate> delegate;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    self.delegate = nil; 
}
@end

//Example of proper ARC usage:

@property (nonatomic, strong) SomeObject *someObject;
//someObject will be automatically released when it is no longer needed.
