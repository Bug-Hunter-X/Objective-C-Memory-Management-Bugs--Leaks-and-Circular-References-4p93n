In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to object ownership and the `retain`/`release` cycle (or its ARC counterpart).  A classic example involves creating an object within a method, and then not properly releasing it before the method returns. This leads to a memory leak.  Another subtle error involves circular references. If object A retains object B, and object B retains object A, neither object will ever be deallocated, even if they are no longer directly accessible, creating a memory leak. Improper use of `copy` versus `retain` can lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes. Incorrect use of delegate patterns, failing to properly set the delegate to nil when an object is deallocated, can cause crashes or unexpected behavior. Consider a situation where object A holds a strong reference to object B as a delegate, and object A is deallocated while object B still holds a strong reference to it.
